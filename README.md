# BugTrackerDell

/* This is a project I worked on when I was just a Dell intern. I created the front-end and back-end 
of this dashboard/webpage to be used for the generating and displaying of the different types of reports
for the Sidewinder Project. The dashboard serves to create a more time efficient and timely way of creating 
different reports, as well as raise insight into the the software development life cycle across products. I made use of
pChart library I found online. The backend is in Perl, the front-end is in HTML,CSS, Javascript */
